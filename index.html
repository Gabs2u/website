        <h1>Myself and I</h1>
        <p> 
            Gabriella Sena Anikpi is my name.I am 18 years of age.
        I am an undergraduate student at the University of Ghana.
        I am offering a very prestigious course, one that is rare but yet lucrative on the job market.
        Sometimes, because of certain things I do to help mankind in my capacity as a human being,
        peopele find my acts very laudable and others too criticise as though they would win the enviable trophy
        <i>"World Criticisers"</i>
        Life can be very tricky sometimes but you have to never let it play you!
        What do I mean? 
        Sometimes...there again I go using sometimes....
        Most at times, I find myself wandering at the surprises that life throws at us.
        I can be found starglazing but my mind is a wanderer in a different universe.
        The point is, no matter what life throws at you,you might nevr be able to get answers to those 
        thoughts, those questions, those outrageous opinions that you badly so want answers to.
        Whoever you are, whatever you believe in, just want to know that evrything that has a start 
        definitely has an end. <b>Believe and Live despite the odds</b>.....you will be just fine!
        </p>
